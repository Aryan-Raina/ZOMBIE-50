## Games Theme And How To Play
Zombie 50 is a **2D top down zombie shooter**. The name is Zombie 50 because of two reasons: it is made as a final project for CS50 and the first wave in game consists of 50 zombies. Zombies appear to be coming out of ground. When you kill all the spawned zombies in the wave you move on to the next wave(There are infinite waves). Killing a zombie gives you some money that you can use in the shop.

You get a score at the end based on your money at that time. A highscore system is also implemented. I have also implemented a working main menu and options screen. You can see player's health in a health bar. You can see your money, game status, wave number, ammo and no of medkits you have on the screen.

**You can buy a medkit from the shop. (fully heals)**

### Controls
- **WASD** and arrow keys are for the **movement**
- **Mouse** to rotate the player and **shoot**
- **M** is to use the **medkit**
- Pressing **Space** when near the shop in the house pops up a **shop** UI
- **1, 2, 3** can be used to **switch guns**
- **R** is to **reload**
